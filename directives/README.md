# Directives

This folder contains SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) written in Markdown.

## What Goes Here

Each directive should define:
- **Goal**: What this directive accomplishes
- **Inputs**: What information/data is needed
- **Tools**: Which execution scripts to use
- **Outputs**: What deliverables are produced
- **Edge Cases**: Common errors and how to handle them
- **Learnings**: Updates based on real-world execution
